      <p>
        The Playfair Cipher was the first digraph substitution cipher,
        encrypting pairs of letters rather than single letters. It was used
        first used by the British in the Second Boer War and World War I, and
        then used again by the British and Australians in World War II. Though
        it is named after Lord Playfair who popularised it, the cipher was
        invented by his friend Charles Wheatstone.
